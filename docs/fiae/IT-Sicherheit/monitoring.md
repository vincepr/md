## best practices for IT monitoring

1. avoid alert fatigue, by setting up to many alerts to overwhelm the IT Team.

2. categorize alerts by level of severity. Low level alerts can be handled automatically or be routed to junior analysts. While severe alerts should be routed immediately to senior staff.

3. delivery path (email, text, mobile) appropriate for the level of alert.

4. create good dashboards and iterate over them.

5. embrace redundancy.
