# Ownership Principles in Rust

## Stack vs Heap
### Stack
- For Fixed length elements (ex i32, Char, float...). 
- Last In, First Out. (so we can just push and pop to it)
- faster
- When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function (including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the functionâ€™s local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those values get popped off the stack.


### Heap
- for elements of varrying size (ex. Strings ...)
- slower. Especially on allocation. Also cleanup/bookkeeping etc.
- 
## Ownership
- each value in Rust has an owner.
- There can only be one owner at a time.
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.
### Difference stack vs heap elements:
Rust does not shallow copy elements by default. For fixed length elements it will just copy the value. For heap elements it will default to moving the value.
```rust
let x = 5;
let y = x;      // just a copy since x is a int and just lives on the stack -> default is a copy

let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1;    // here rust s1 goes out of scope; only s2 is accessible afterwards. 
```
```rust
fn main(){
    let s = String::from("hello");
    let x = 10;
    makescopy(x);
    makescopy(x);       // x is still available since it got copied
    takes_ownership(s); // s is "gone" after here
}
fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
  // memory is freed.
```
- We can implement the `Copy` trait to add this first behavior to custom types.
    - similar there is a `Drop` trait, for actions that need to happen if the object goes out of scope.
- Ways to deal with Ownership are:
#### Variables and Data interacting with Clone
to deeply copy heap data we can use the clone method.
```rust
let s1 = String::from("hello");
let s2 = s1.clone();
```

#### Return the args back in a touple
```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    (s2, length) = get_len(s1);
    println!("{s2} has a length of: {length}");
}
fn get_len(s: String) -> (String, usize){
    let length = s.len();
    (s, length)
}
```

#### References and Borrowing
Unlike a pointer a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value, for the life of that reference.

This is called borrowing. By default references are immutable.

Two borrowing rules that always must hold true:
- At any given time, you can have either (but not both) one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let len = get_len(&s1);
    println!("{s1} has the length of: {len}");
}
fn get_len(s: &String) -> usize{
    s.len()
}
```
- mutable References:
```rust
fn main() {
    let mut s = String::from("hello");
    change(&mut s);
}
fn change(s: &mut String){
    s.push_str(", world");
}
```
Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value. Code that attempts to create two mutable references to s will fail. This is our saveguard against dataraces, or dangling references.
- as always we can use curly brackets to create new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references:
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
{
    let r0 = &mut s;
}
// new scope so no problem
let r1 = &s;
let r2 = &s;    // only read-access so no problem
println!("{} and {}", r1, r2);
// since r1 and r2 are not used after this we can now:
let r3 = &mut s;    
println!("{}", r2);


```
Recap on Rules of References:
- At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
- References must always be valid.

#### Slice Type
slices let you refernce a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection rather than the whole collection. A slice is a reference and thus has no ownership.
```rust
let s = String::from("hello world");
let len = s.len();

let hello1 = &s[0..5];      // start_index is inclusive; end_index is exclusive
let hello2 = &s[..5];       // same as above

let world1 = &s[6..11];
let world2 = &s[6..len];
let world3 = &s[6..];       // all 3 the same

let s2 = &s[..]             // whole string
```
- CAREFUL: indexes must occur at valid utf8 boundaries. And *multibyte* characters exist in utf8!


deref coercions:
```rust
// get_first_word(s: &String) -> &str // would only allow Strings as args
// the below allows both string literals and Strings and slices of those as args.
fn get_first_word(s: &str)-> &str{
    let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
    for (idx, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
        if item == b' ' {
            return &s[0..idx];
        }
    }
}
fn main() {
    let my_string = String::from("hello world");
    let my_string_literal = "hello world";

    let word = get_first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
    let word = get_first_word(&my_string[..]);
    let word = get_first_word(&my_string);

    let word = get_first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
    let word = get_first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);
    let word = get_first_word(&my_string_literal);
}
```
- other slices
```rust
let a = [1,2,3,4,5];
let slice = &a[1..3];
assert_eq!(slice, &[2,3]);
```
